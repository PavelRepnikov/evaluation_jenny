A# Evaluation Report: Parler-TTS-mini-jenny-30H

## Overview

This report documents the evaluation of the synthesized speech generated by the `Parler-TTS-mini-jenny-30H` model. The model was fine-tuned on the Jenny dataset, and the goal of this evaluation was to assess the quality of the generated audio using various objective metrics. The key metrics used were:

1. **Mel Cepstral Distortion (MCD)**: Measures the difference between the spectral envelopes of the generated and reference audio.
2. **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**: Evaluates the amount of distortion in the generated audio compared to the reference audio.
3. **Word Error Rate (WER)**: Measures the accuracy of the generated speech in terms of matching the expected text.
4. **Manual MOS**

## Setup

### Dataset
- **Generated Audio**: The model generated 19 audio samples (`sample_1.wav` to `sample_19.wav`) based on various input texts.
- **Reference Audio**: 5 reference audio files (`20.wav` to `25.wav`) were used for comparison to evaluate the quality of the generated audio.

### Transcription
The `SpeechRecognition` library was used to transcribe the generated audio to obtain the corresponding text outputs for WER calculation. The transcriptions were generated using the Google Web Speech API, and the results were saved in the list `generated_texts`.

### Evaluation Metrics
1. **Mel Cepstral Distortion (MCD)**: 
   - MCD was calculated by comparing each generated audio sample to each reference audio file. 
   - MCD scores provide a measure of how closely the synthesized speech matches the target speech in terms of spectral envelope shape.
   
2. **Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)**:
   - SNR was calculated to assess the level of distortion in the synthesized audio. Higher SNR values indicate lower distortion.

3. **Word Error Rate (WER)**:
   - WER was calculated by comparing the transcriptions of the generated audio with the corresponding reference texts. WER measures the percentage of words that were incorrectly transcribed.

4. **Manual MOS**
   - MOS was calculated manually by the author and his brother

## Conclusion

The evaluation of the Parler-TTS-mini-jenny-30H model reveals the following insights:

- **MCD**: The model generally produced audio with a reasonable Mel Cepstral Distortion score. Samples such as `sample_19.wav` had the lowest MCD, indicating the highest quality synthesis.
- **SNR**: Signal-to-noise ratio was below 0 dB for most samples, indicating some level of distortion in the generated audio. Two samples (`sample_14.wav` and `sample_19.wav`) showed particularly high distortion levels.
- **WER**: The average WER of 14.32% suggests that the modelâ€™s synthesized speech is generally intelligible, but with some notable word-level errors.

Overall, the model performs reasonably well in terms of synthesized speech quality, with some areas for improvement, particularly in terms of distortion (SNR) and intelligibility (WER).

## Recommendations

- **Further Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuning the model on a larger dataset with more diverse speech patterns could improve the MCD and WER scores.
- **Post-Processing**: Implementing noise reduction techniques during or after synthesis could help improve the SNR values.
